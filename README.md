# Test Codes for Manuscript
 Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation
 
 In order to run the codes:
 * ODEINT:
     * for all the codes the [Boost Library](https://www.boost.org/) is necessary of which odeint is part
     * for the files *\*_vcl.cpp* the [Vectorclass Library](https://github.com/vectorclass/version2) is also needed
     * the Thrust GPU codes additionaly need the [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) and should be compiled with *nvcc*
